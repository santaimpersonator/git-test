        Please make sure an issue is being reported here; this is not an appropriate channel for questions or assistance on a product. Here are some simple steps to verify that you haven't missed an instruction, which could solve your issue:
        * Please double-check the [hookup guide](https://sparkfun.github.io/git-test) and verify that you have completed your setup correctly.
          * Please test your board with one of the included examples to verify that the board is operating with its basic functionality.
          * Verify that you are using the latest software development environment and library/package release *(unless specified otherwise)*.
        * Please take a look at the [troubleshooting tips](https://sparkfun.github.io/git-test/troubleshooting_tips/) for common mistakes you could have overlooked.
        * For some common troubleshooting tips, please head over to the [SparkFun Technical Assistance](https://www.sparkfun.com/technical_assistance) page.
        * For questions about a product that is not working as expected, please post a topic in the [SparkFun Forums](https://forum.sparkfun.com/index.php).
        * If you are still experiencing the issue, please provide as many details as possible below about your hardware, computer setup, and code.

        Before reporting a new issue, please search the [list of existing hardware issues](https://github.com/sparkfun/git-test/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ahardware+) to avoid creating duplicates. Otherwise, if you spotted an unlisted error in our design, please continue filling out this form: 
        * Provide a concise title summarizing the problem (eg. **Incorrect silk** or **`<Feature>` not working**)
        * Screenshots are extremely helpful and it is easy to [attach files](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/attaching-files) into GitHub issues:
          * Select Files:
            ![Select attachments from computer](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-42604/mw-1000/images/help/pull_requests/select-bar.webp)
          * Drag and Drop Files:

        * When referencing information from a datasheet:
          * Specify, link, or attach the datasheet.
          * Provide the section that the information is in (eg. section 5.1.2) or quote the information exactly
